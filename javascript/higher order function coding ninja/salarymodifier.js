// Suppose you have a list of employees in a company, and each employee is represented as an object with the following properties:


// "id" - a unique identifier for the employee
// "name" - the employee's name
// "department" - the department the employee works in
// "salary" - the employee's current salary



// Objectives:

// You want to make a modification to the list of employees to reflect a recent company-wide salary increase. You have been provided with the following information:
// Salaries for employees in the "sales" department should be increased by 10%.
// Salaries for employees in the "engineering" department should be increased by 15%.
// Salaries for employees in all other departments should be increased by 5%.
// You need to write a function "increaseSalaries" that takes an array of employee objects and returns a new array of employee objects where each employee's salary has been updated based on their department. The original array of employees should be left unchanged.

// Note:
// The salary should be converted to one decimal place using toFixed().

// Hint:
// Use the map function to iterate over every object in the array
