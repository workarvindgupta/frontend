// You are tasked with creating a program to calculate the price of a pizza based on its size, quantity and selected toppings.



// Objectives
// The pricing is determined as follows:
// - The base price of the pizza depends on its size, which can be small, medium, or large.
// Small: $8.00
// Medium: $10.00
// Large: $12.00
// - Each topping selected for the pizza incurs an additional cost of $1.50 per topping.
// Write a JavaScript function pizzaPricing, that takes the size of the pizza as a parameter in form of string and returns a curried function.
// The curried function should take an array of selected toppings as a parameter and return another function. The final function should take the quantity of pizzas as a parameter, calculate the total price and return the total price.
// Implement the pizzaPricing function and ensure that the returned function correctly calculates the total price based on the given parameters. 

// Note:
// The final result should be up to 2 decimal places.



function pizzaPricing(size) {
    const basePrice = {
      small: 8.0,
      medium: 10.0,
      large: 12.0
    };

    return function (selectedToppings) {
      return function (quantity) {
        const toppingsCost = selectedToppings.length * 1.5;
        const totalPrice = basePrice[size] + toppingsCost;
        return (totalPrice * quantity).toFixed(2);
      };
    };
  }
